This is my personal website.

## Performance

Web tech is painful to use. HTML/JS is clunky, slow, and unintuitive. Trying to
make the development experience better by using a JS framework always introduces
a big learning curve for something that will be outdated in a few years at most.
And while much of the time frameworks like React make writing websites better,
the massive weight of these libraries nearly always has major impacts on the
size and performace on the site.

I want to keep track of the size of the website as I move from framework to
framework in search of something that works for me. Let's go!
