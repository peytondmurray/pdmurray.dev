Ever since I started using ~~Manjaro~~ Arch Linux as my primary desktop I've been unable to get the
Spotify web player to run. So I've been stuck using the awful native Spotify player available on the
AUR. I'm happy to report that I've just figured out how to get the web player working, and it's
super easy. Incidentally, some youtube videos also refuse to play (but not all) (?).

The Spotify web player relies on a plugin (?) called widevine which allows DRM-protected content to
be played. This plugin doesn't install when you install Vivaldi from the AUR, because something
something free software open source, which is all fine and good but I want music and video. In fact,
if you `ls -l /opt/vivaldi` you'll notice there's a symbolic link which points to
`/opt/google/chrome/libwidevinecdm.so`. For me there was no file at this location, but a quick
search turned up this [help page](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/netflix-on-linux/) which
talks about enabling streaming of DRM-protected content. Helpfully, the Vivaldi team has
provided a [script](https://gist.github.com/ruario/3c873d43eb20553d5014bd4d29fe37f1) which
downloads and installs the plugin for you. After running the script and restarting Vivaldi, the
problem was solved. Although I don't have Netflix or HBO, presumably this fixes playback issues
with those platforms as well.

Update: So I just switched over to Arch Linux, which is even more awesome than Manjaro, but was
again unable to get proprietary content to play in Vivaldi, even after installing widevine. At this
point, I've also followed the instructions for [enabling proprietary media on
linux](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/html5-proprietary-media-on-linux/). After doing all that,
Youtube and Spotify work flawlessly.
