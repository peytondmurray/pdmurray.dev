## Simulating an image of a black hole

What would it look like if we could take a picture of a black hole? As it turns out, it looks like
this:

<CenteredImage
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Black_hole_-_Messier_87_crop_max_res.jpg/1920px-Black_hole_-_Messier_87_crop_max_res.jpg"
    alt="Direct image of the black hole at the core of Messier 87."
    width="30%"
/>

In 1977, nobody knew what these objects looked like. J-P Luminet was the first to produce a
simulated image of a black hole in a paper published that year:

<CenteredImage
    src={Luminet}
    alt="J-P Luminet's famous simulated image of a black hole from his 1977 paper."
    width="50%"
/>

I have no idea what kind of computer was used to produce this image, but I'm guessing he used punch
cards. With modern computers, how hard could it be to recreate this result? As it turns out, it's
pretty tricky. Here's my effort:

    alt="My simulated image of a black hole."
