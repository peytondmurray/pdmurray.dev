            Hi! I'm Peyton. Currently I work for <a href="https://www.quansight.com/">Quansight</a>
            where I build open source software; sometimes I do contracting work through my company.
            Before I was a programmer, I studied nanoscale magnetism as a postdoc at the <a
                href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/computational-physics">Computational Physics
            Laboratory</a> at Tampere University. At UC Davis I studied nanoscale magnetism from an
            experimental perspective as part of the <a
                href="http://kailiu.georgetown.domains/research/">Liu Lab</a> - which has since
            moved to Georgetown University. In my free time I like to write software for science,
            and am an active contributor to several open source projects. I'm driven by the desire
            to make computational power more accessible to more people around the world - especially
            in support of scientific research.
