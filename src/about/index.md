Hi! I'm Peyton. I love open source software, science, and data viz. I'm a
software engineer for Quansight based out of California.

Before I was a software engineer, I studied nanoscale magnetism as a postdoc at
the [Computational Physics Laboratory][tampere] at Tampere University, and at UC
Davis as a graduate student in [Kai Liu's lab][ucdavis], which has since moved
to Georgetown University.

I'm an active contributor to several open source project, and am driven by the
desier to make computational power more accessible to people around the world -
especially in support of scientific research.
