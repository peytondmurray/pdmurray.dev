## Simulating an image of a black hole

What would it look like if we could take a picture of a black hole? As it turns
out, it looks like this.

In 1977, nobody knew what these objects looked like. J-P Luminet was the first
to produce a simulated image of a black hole in a paper published that year:

I have no idea what kind of computer was used to produce this image, but I'm
guessing Luminet used punch cards. With modern computers, how hard could it be
to recreate this result? As it turns out, it's pretty tricky. Here's my effort:
