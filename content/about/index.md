Hi! I'm Peyton.

Currently I work for [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) where I build open
source software.

Before I was a programmer, I studied nanoscale magnetism as a postdoc at the
[Computational Physics
Laboratory](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/computational-physics) at Tampere
University. At UC Davis I studied nanoscale magnetism from an experimental
perspective as part of the [Liu
Lab](http://kailiu.georgetown.domains/research/), which has since moved to
Georgetown University.

In my free time I like to write software for science, and am an active
contributor to several open source projects. I'm driven by the desire to make
computational power more accessible to more people around the world - especially
in support of scientific research.
